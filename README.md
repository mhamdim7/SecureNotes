## Architecture Overview

SecureNotes is built on Hexagonal Architecture, mainly organized into:

- **Domain Layer**: Defines core business logic and models, establishing the application's fundamental operations.
- **Application Layer**: Contains the use cases that dictate the application's functionality, bridging the domain with the outer world.
- **Adapter Layer**: Connects the application to external services and interfaces, including UI, database access, and framework-specific features.
